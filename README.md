- Minimax-based AI opponent
- SwiftUI interface with animations

## Project Tasks

The following list outlines the major tasks planned for the project:

1. **Project setup** – create a Swift Package Manager project and configure Git.
2. **Chess game logic** – implement piece models and movement rules.
3. **AI opponent** – add a Minimax-based algorithm for the computer player.
4. **SwiftUI interface** – build a responsive chessboard UI with animations.
5. **Game state management** – track moves, turns and game status.
6. **Testing** – write unit tests for move validation and AI logic.
7. **Documentation** – keep this README and source comments up to date.
8. **Open-source compliance** – provide a license and contribution guidelines.
