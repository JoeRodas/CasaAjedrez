# Casa Ajedrez

Casa Ajedrez is an open-source iOS chess app built with Swift and SwiftUI. It features comprehensive piece logic and rule validation along with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The project emphasizes accurate game state handling, smooth animations, and clean board rendering.

## Features

- Full chess rules and piece movement
- Minimax-based AI opponent
- SwiftUI interface with animations

## Project Tasks

The following list outlines the major tasks planned for the project:

1. **Project setup** – create a Swift Package Manager project and configure Git.
2. **Chess game logic** – implement piece models and movement rules.
3. **AI opponent** – add a Minimax-based algorithm for the computer player.
4. **SwiftUI interface** – build a responsive chessboard UI with animations.
5. **Game state management** – track moves, turns and game status.
6. **Testing** – write unit tests for move validation and AI logic.
7. **Documentation** – keep this README and source comments up to date.
8. **Open-source compliance** – provide a license and contribution guidelines.

## Repository Status

The repository now contains a basic Swift package with initial chess logic,
a placeholder AI opponent and sample tests. Additional features will be added
incrementally.
